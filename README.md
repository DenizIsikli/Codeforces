# Codeforces
This repository contains my solutions to the problems on [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/). The solutions are available in C++.

## Codeforces Profile
- [Codeforces Profile](https://codeforces.com/profile/Berxwedan)

## Template Setup For C++
- templateSTD.cpp (Standard Template)
- templateSTDOCF.cpp (Old School Codeforce Template)
- templateWS.cpp (Template W. Solve Function)
- templateWoS.cpp (Template Wo. Solve Function)

## Compile and Run Script Setup (Optional)
To simplify compiling and running your C++ solutions, you can use the included PowerShell script located in the `script` folder.

### Adding Script to Environment Variables
If you want to use the script globally from any terminal location, add the `script` folder path to your system's environment variables.

- Locate the full path of the `script` folder in this repository.
- Add that folder path to your system's PATH environment variable.

After this, you can run the script like this from any directory:

```
compile_n_run.ps1 <path_to_your_cpp_file>
```

This makes compiling and running your solutions faster and easier during contests.
